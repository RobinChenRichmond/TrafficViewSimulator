# TrafficViewSimulator

This is a group project for the Software Engineering Practicum course (CMSC-322). The program work as a Traffic Intersection Simulator to simulate the prcess of traffic in the city grid. It reads a file with data about the configuration of a Traffic Grid and some cars, does multiple iterations and simulates the situation of the Traffic Grid in each iteration. The final goal of a Roundabout Simulator has not been achieved, but the basic Intersection Simulator has been finished.

This program contains five classes: TrafficTesterView, TrafficTesterModel, Intersection, Lane, Car; one Requirements file: Requirements; one analysis file: Analysis; two tester files: data1_for_TrafficTesterView, data2_for_TrafficTesterView.
